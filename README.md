# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

In support of our previous report on ride-sharing data, upper management has asked we produce this supplementary report which analyzes ride-sharing data by city type: rural, suburban, and urban. Specifically, a summary table of the information will be provided, as well as a multiple line chart which illustrates the total weekly fares for each city type over a 4-month period. Finally, conclusions will be drawn, and recommendations will be made.

## Results

### Figure B

As is evident in the chart in Figure A, there is a direct corrleation between population density and the 5 metrics recorded here. Specifically, as location population density increases...
  * total rides increase
  * total drivers increase
  * total fares increase
  * average fare per rider decreases
  * average fare per driver decreases 

To further illustrate this point, the line graph in Figure B shows a more longitudinal view of this relationship, indicating this relationship is fairly stable over time, or at least over the period recorded in the chart. 

## Recommendations 

Overall there are a number of conclusions we can draw from this data. The biggest takeaway from this analysis is that although the average fare price is much higher in rural areas, there simply are not enough passengers to make up the volume needed to compete with more densely populated markets. Furthermore, because there also is evidently a shortage of drivers in this market, rates have to be increased to encourage driver participation. This undoubtedly suppresses further adoption by potential rural customers. Our recommendation is for PyBer to focus their efforts on maintaining and growing market share in larger markets where economies of scale mean far higher volumes of rides and therefore greater profits, even if each individual fare is low. Mid-size markets also provide a modest profit, and could be supported by advertising common routes and ride sharing to encourage further adoption. Finally, if management is set on remaining in rural markets, temporary subsidies could be employed to help offset the high fare cost for riders, and encourage more drivers to sign up. These subsidies could be reduced gradually as more riders and drivers participated, and economies of scale kicked in.
